# Book Review Management Script

## Description

This Python script manages book reviews by interacting with a Notion database. It reads book review data from a CSV file, calculates book metrics, and updates the Notion database with the latest information.

## How to Run the Program

1. **Set up your environment:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Create a 'take-home.env' file with your Notion API key and database ID.
   - Prepare a CSV file 'ratings.csv' with your book review data (book title, reviewer, rating).

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - You can use `pip` to install the necessary libraries. Run the following command:
     ```
     pip install notion-client python-dotenv
     ```

3. **Execute the Script:**
   - Run the program by executing the Python script in your terminal:
     ```
     python script_name.py
     ```

## Questions and Answers

- **Was there anything you got stuck on, and if so what did you do to resolve it?**
  - During the development process, I faced a crucial decision point where I had to determine how to handle updates to existing book review entries in the Notion database. One option was to delete and recreate pages when updates were needed, while the other was to adopt an approach that never deletes pages but instead modifies them. After careful consideration, I chose the latter approach, which ensures that existing data remains intact and avoids unnecessary deletion or duplication of pages. This decision was made to provide a more robust and user-friendly solution for managing book reviews, even if it posed certain complexities in updating existing entries.
- **Do you have any suggestions for improving the API documentation to make it clearer or easier to use?**
  - The provided API documentation for the `main` function is already clear and informative. To make it even clearer, consider adding more specific examples or usage scenarios.

## Sources

- [Notion API Documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started)
  - This documentation provides information on how to use the Notion API to interact with Notion databases.

## Libraries Used

- **Notion Client Library (`notion_client`)**: Used for interacting with the Notion API to read and update data in the Notion database.
- **Python-Dotenv Library (`python-dotenv`)**: Used for loading environment variables from the 'take-home.env' file.

## Next Steps

Here are some next steps to consider for enhancing this script:

- **Add Unit Tests:** Develop unit tests to run the script on a variety of different CSV files and starting databases. Ensure that the output remains consistent based on the CSV file. This will help verify the script's reliability and robustness.
- **CSV Format Checks:** Implement checks to ensure that the CSV file is properly formatted with the correct schema. This can include verifying the presence of required columns and data types.
- **Duplicate Entry Handling:** Add logic to handle duplicate entries in the Notion database. Consider options such as merging duplicate entries or providing clear notifications for users when duplicates are detected.

Feel free to prioritize and implement these next steps to further improve the functionality and reliability of the script.
